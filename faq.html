			<p class="question">Where is the data stored?</p>
			<p class="answer">
				Our data is currently stored in Amazon S3 in the United States. All
				content is legal under the US law. This means we may be forced to remove
				copyrighted or illegal material.
			</p>

			<p class="question">How do I use this service?</p>
			<p class="answer">
				There are a ton of ways to hook into the API for OwO, if you're not very
				tech savvy (or just cant be bothered), there's a <a href="https://github.com/deansheather/owo.whats-th.is/wiki/Guide-for-ShareX">ShareX</a>
				and <a href="https://github.com/deansheather/owo.whats-th.is/wiki/Guide-for-MacOS">MacOS</a> script, however if you want to write your own, 
				or your script isn't supported, please checkout the API <a href="#">here</a>.

			<p class="question">Private? I wanna upload!</p>
				Currently, we're not accepting new users on the ser
			<p class="answer">vice, as we're
				constantly making improvements to our backend and distribution
				infrastructure and configuration. Shoot us an email and we'll get back
				to you at a later date.
			</p>

			<p class="question">What's the maximum filesize I can upload?</p>
			<p class="answer">
				Currently the max filesize that you can upload to our server is 80MiB.
				This is to prevent large files taking up a lot of space, and costing a
				lot to store.
			</p>

			<p class="question">What filetypes are allowed?</p>
			<p class="answer">
				Currently, we have very strict filetype checking and only allow a small
				whitelist of files. You should be able to upload most image types and a
				few other types. If you would like us to allow another filetype, please
				send us an email. We hope to open this up when we leave beta.
			</p>

			<p class="question">I don't like something hosted here.</p>
			<p class="answer">
				We're sorry to hear about that. If any images infringe on your rights or
				the rights of an entity you represent, please shoot us an email using
				the link in the footer. Make sure to provide us with the URL(s) of the
				files in question.
